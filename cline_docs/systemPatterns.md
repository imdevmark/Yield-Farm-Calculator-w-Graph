# System Patterns

## How the system is built
The system is built as a React application using Vite as the build tool. It uses TypeScript for type safety. The UI components are likely built using a component library, possibly Radix UI based on the dependencies.

## Key technical decisions
- Using React for the UI framework.
- Using Vite for fast development and build times.
- Using TypeScript for type safety.
- Using a component library for UI elements.

## Architecture patterns
The application appears to follow a standard component-based architecture, with components organized in the `src/components` directory.
